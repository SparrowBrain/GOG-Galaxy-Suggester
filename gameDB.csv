Age of Wonders III,"Age of Wonders III, like the previous games in the series is a turn-based strategy game set within a high fantasy universe where the player assumes the role of a political-military leader. Gameplay is 4X-based (explore, expand, exploit and exterminate) where players explore the world map, slowly building an empire through colonization, warfare and diplomacy with rival powers. However new to III is the greater addition of role-playing game features, where players must first choose and customize their leader, all options dependant on the player's chosen style of play. There are six available races in the initial release: humans, draconians, high elves, dwarves, orcs, and goblins, all that will determine the race of their empire with each having unique perks and abilities. The leader and empire is further shaped by the choice from skill sets based on traditional RPG classes along with further specializations and skills to select. Each leader class also has access to their own unique units with a distinct visual look based on their corresponding race, each to accommodate their own unique approach to strategy, both in combat and when managing their empire. On release there are six different classes a leader can be. The ""Sorcerer"" class emphasizes the use of magic for enchantments and summoning powerful units. The ""Theocrat"" derives from an organized religion based society including zealots followers and the use of holy spells and warriors. The ""Rogue"" favors less direct approaches to situations, employing stealth, thievery and manipulation aswell as dark magic in diplomacy and warfare. The ""Archdruid"" channels the power of nature, using it to their advantage by being very self-sufficient and being able to call upon wild creatures. The ""Dreadnaught"" leads a steampunk styled society, using large industry, machinery and gunpowder-based units like cannons and tanks. Finally the ""Warlord"" specializes in direct conflict and combat tactics, utilizing effective non-magic based units and abilities.\nLeaders themselves and separate recruitable hero units will be able to gain experience and level up, while also being able to gain new equipment and powers. Players can also develop their alignment between good and evil based on their player's actions and the cultures the player absorbs into their empire, rather than race like the previous games in the series.\nCities themselves provide much of the resources, infrastructure and host to unit recruitment. Independent cities and units not immediately aligned to any player/leader are also present in the world map. Units that come from an unaffiliated city will fight to protect a city's domain, and they won't forget that they're tied to it. Many of these independent settlements aren't cities in the traditional sense, but can be alternative settlements, like a ""Giant's Keep"" for example. The player can conquer these holdings, which will provide units like a city, or they can absorb them through diplomatic means by paying tribute and diplomatic and/or alignment standing. Quests can also be given to players by independent forces and cities, including but not limited to clearing out wild units, searching for relics and even conquering cities and other holdings. Quests can grant the support of independent forces for player in addition to a reward such as gold or equipment, sometimes with the choice of either given to the player upon completion of the quest.\nAs in the case of the first game in the series, Age of Wonders III offers a story-driven campaign that is playable from two sides, the human-centric Commonwealth Empire and the Court of the High Elves. In addition to the campaign; single-player scenarios, online multiplayer, random map generation and a map editor are also available.[3] The graphics of Age of Wonders III will be presented in 3D instead of the isometric view the series has utilized up to this point.",['Steam'],80,['Triumph Studios'],"['Role-playing (RPG)', 'Strategy', 'Tactical']",['Triumph Studios'],2014-03-31,"['4X (explore, expand, exploit, and exterminate)', 'Fantasy']",,,https://images.gog.com/6511d6472e7f59eb3767a38264992e6fab29fc4ca9e91417c0c7870db405b80f_glx_bg_top_padding_7.webp?namespace=gamesdb,https://images.gog.com/6bf5b2b407809686ceec420388df9b0a496a42cda53388907abe9b13285c3789_glx_square_icon_v2.webp?namespace=gamesdb,https://images.gog.com/6bf5b2b407809686ceec420388df9b0a496a42cda53388907abe9b13285c3789_glx_vertical_cover.webp?namespace=gamesdb

Alan Wake's American Nightmare,"The plot of American Nightmare is framed by the narration of an episode of the fictional TV show, ""Night Springs,"" which follows the style of The Twilight Zone and appeared on television screens throughout the original Alan Wake.\nAlan Wake's friend and manager, Barry, is asleep in a motel room. The narration explains that Alan is attempting to chase down the ""herald of darkness"", Mr. Scratch, who is Alan's evil doppelganger created by a dark force. Scratch is determined to take away everything Alan loves, including his wife, Alice. Alan, as the ""champion of light,"" has the ability to rewrite reality, and was able to write his escape from Cauldron Lake in Washington. He ends up near the small town of Night Springs, Arizona, and learns that he has been missing from the real world for nearly two years.\nA nearby oil derrick erupts with several foes controlled by Mr. Scratch. Seeking light, Alan runs to a nearby motel, where he encounters Emma Sloan, who at first thinks he is Mr. Scratch, since they look identical. She tells Alan that Scratch was at the motel the night before, and provides Alan with a typewritten page, a way to alter reality to destroy the derrick and stop the foes. Alan follows its instructions, which causes a meteor to collide with an artificial satellite, sending it hurtling towards the ground, where it then collides with the oil derrick. While Alan is away performing this task, the dark forces consume Emma.\nFollowing clues he found at the motel, along with a set of keys, Alan heads to a nearby observatory. There, Dr. Rachel Meadows, who also met Mr. Scratch previously, is tracking a mysterious signal sent just before the satellite was knocked out of orbit. Rachel tells Alan that Mr. Scratch was very interested in this signal, and Alan surmises that it must contain the key to fighting the darkness. While attempting to obtain the complete signal, the observatory's telescope is sabotaged by the darkness, which reinforces Alan's belief that the signal contains something he needs. After repairing the damage, a portion of the signal comes through that translates into a page of a story: a new reality that Alan can presumably implement.\nThe page points him to a nearby drive-in theater, where he meets Serena Valdivia, who is under the influence of the darkness. After freeing her by restoring power and switching the lights on, Serena tells Alan that Mr. Scratch is trying to prevent the sun from ever rising again. She gives Alan the security code to the projection room where he can change reality. Alan uses the incomplete message to try to set the new reality. However, as the message is only partial, the new reality does not take effect. Mr. Scratch appears, gloating, and sends Alan back in time to a few hours before.\nWaking up again near the motel, Alan repeats many of the same motions. Emma and Rachel still have some deja vu of the previous loop's events, and have helped perform some of Alan's previous tasks for him. Despite his efforts to change events this time around, Emma is nevertheless consumed again by the darkness. Rachel is able to capture a longer portion of the signal this time, but it is still incomplete. When Alan returns to the drive-in theater, he is again unable to complete the new reality and is sent back in time again by Mr. Scratch.\nAlan repeats his actions for a third time, but this time, he is able to save Emma and gain the complete message from Rachel. He sets the correct series of events in the projection room, which triggers the projector to show a film made by Alice. Mr. Scratch appears again, but discovers that Alan has successfully written the new reality, and he is burned out of existence by the film. On the screen, Alan appears to reunite with Alice along a sun-lit shoreline; however, the narrator notes that this could quite possibly be just a figment of Alan's imagination, since he is still trapped in the Dark Place.\nDuring the credits, it is revealed that the name of the episode of Night Springs that Alan wrote himself into was titled ""Return"", a reference to the manuscript he began to type at the end of Special Two: The Writer.\nAfter completion of the game's credits, Barry wakes up suddenly, believing he has heard Alan's voice.","['Epic Games Store', 'Steam']",79,['Remedy Entertainment'],"['Adventure', 'Shooter']","['Microsoft Studios', 'Nordic Games Publishing']",2012-05-22,"['Action', 'Drama', 'Horror', 'Science fiction']",,,https://images.gog.com/07db9684e57a5ce4e02d470d316381bf1ad56863075db02431bd8a1f70538f14_glx_bg_top_padding_7.webp?namespace=gamesdb,https://images.gog.com/19d68e040c7a171b23746476ded9d400308b32dbc2467fdee1c49b599301348b_glx_square_icon_v2.webp?namespace=gamesdb,https://images.gog.com/3c614bc0e5cf4cf19b2e750aa6293992c35fce7bb6a214e28db29adcb0ca4094_glx_vertical_cover.webp?namespace=gamesdb

Darksiders II: Deathinitive Edition,"A remastered version of the 2012 release, Darksiders II.\n\nAwakened by the End of Days, Death, the most feared of the legendary Four Horsemen, embarks upon a quest to restore mankind, and redeem his brother's name. Along the way, the Horseman discovers that there are far worse things than an earthly Apocalypse, and that an ancient grudge may threaten all of Creation.\n\nDarksiders II follows the exploits of Death, one of the four horsemen of the Apocalypse, in an action-packed tale that runs parallel to the events in the original Darksiders game. This epic journey propels Death across an expansive gameworld as he tries to redeem his brother, War, the horseman blamed for prematurely starting the Apocalypse in Darksiders.\n\nLike the original Darksiders game before it, the second iteration of the series is primarily a hack 'n slash adventure. The game takes place across netherworld environments, including 'The White city', an outpost where angels live, and 'The Eternal Throne', a floating fortress where the Lords of the Dead stand guard over souls that need to be cleansed. Although Death is the most feared of the Four Horsemen, his physical abilities are very different than his brother, War. Death is far more nimble, and relies on a combination of melee and ranged attacks. In combat Death's primary weapon is his huge iconic scythe, with a wide range of other weapons and usable items that must be gathered as the game progresses. Weapons can be dual-wielded, upgradable armor can be acquired for protection and Death has access to his terrifying and powerful mount, Despair.","['Epic Games Store', 'Humble Bundle', 'Steam']",75,"['THQ Nordic', 'Vigil Games']","['Adventure', ""Hack and slash/Beat 'em up"", 'Puzzle', 'Role-playing (RPG)']",['THQ Nordic'],2015-10-27,"['Action', 'Fantasy', 'Open world']",,,https://images.gog.com/ecc0fcc83a826df4c65dbd2b801181f23ce9ff7e42e683f04f71384afd14aeb5_glx_bg_top_padding_7.webp?namespace=gamesdb,https://images.gog.com/c9e2568e308fce6dd0a6a7360811b230a69a7d869be476eb63133abddad0d5e2_glx_square_icon_v2.webp?namespace=gamesdb,https://images.gog.com/a2208e1ee0230ed493013cd695837bee743d4ab038f9bf6f260d9452021326ec_glx_vertical_cover.webp?namespace=gamesdb

Doomdark's Revenge,"The follow-up to the original Lords of Midnight game uses a similar game system to its predecessor, but the story is now much more complex. Luxor the Moonprince's son Morkin has been kidnapped by Shareth, daughter of Doomdark, the evil ruler deposed in the first game. The player initially takes control of Luxor, Rothron the Wise, and Morkin's lover Tarithel the Fey, although many more characters can be recruited as the game progresses, as they aim to banish Shareth and rescue Morkin. Shareth has brainwashed him, so he must also be turned back to Luxor's side.\n\nThe game is effectively turn-based; your characters move by day (with a limited amount of movement possible, with each move in one of the 8 compass directions) and Shareth's by night. You will find plains, mountains, forests, underground tunnels and mysterious temples on your journey. A dark mist follows much of the area, which causes your characters to deteriorate in mood and thus become less effective.\n\nThe characters are now split into five distinct tribes - Giant, Dwarf, Fey, Icemark and Barbarians, and recruiting new characters into your party isn't automatic - factors such as the game situation can make some refuse to join, turn on members of other races, or defect (as the Utarg did in the first game).\n\nThere are several different objectives and possible outcomes to the game. Bringing Morkin back to the Gates of Varenorn is the most basic one, but many other characters ought to be saved, Shareth can be killed completely (with practice!), and there are many Crowns of Icemark to be retrieved. As in the first game, control of the full party only remains while Luxor is alive - his death means total defeat.",['GOG'],,,"['Role-playing (RPG)', 'Strategy', 'Tactical']","['Beyond', 'Chilli Hugger Software Ltd']",2014-02-17,['Fantasy'],,,https://images.gog.com/1c7f4816a1ef1a0e4a718da2d39720aa6d9a1d73fac1df4efcc5946761950bea_glx_bg_top_padding_7.webp?namespace=gamesdb,https://images.gog.com/8977fcf13b655e7e1f9dac3dfbed01208eac1cd93e148efa9434dbf45e2275f4_glx_square_icon_v2.webp?namespace=gamesdb,https://images.gog.com/8977fcf13b655e7e1f9dac3dfbed01208eac1cd93e148efa9434dbf45e2275f4_glx_vertical_cover.webp?namespace=gamesdb

However, strange events started happening one after the other: the guardian of the labyrinth died, his daughter disappeared, and King Bodd apparently fell under some sort of a curse.

As if that weren't enough, Blount also gets bitten by a werewolf and falls in love, and must find a way to deal with both predicaments.\n\nGoblins Quest is the third entry in the Gobliiins series.

However, at various points of the game Blount will require assistance from other player-controlled characters such as Chump the parrot, Ooya the magician, and Fulbert the snake. In addition, Blount's own spontaneous transformation into a werewolf may affect the solution of some puzzles.

God's Trigger,"""God’s Trigger is a fast paced, top-down, 3D action slasher where you, as a former army veteran and now a priest, begin your crusade against the evil of our times - gangs, drugs, human trafficking. You’re filled with God’s will to purify the world from its depravity. You are the hand of God and there will be no mercy for sinners!\n\nThe main and most unique gameplay mechanics in God’s Trigger is called Divine Focus and gives the player the ability to avoid bullets and tactically plan his attacks. The time is running normally for as long as the player keeps moving. As soon as Zoran stops though, the time slows down too.

HITMAN,"Become the Master Assassin in an intense spy-thriller story. As Agent 47, you perform contract hits on powerful, high-profile targets in exotic locations around the world. Gameplay focuses on taking out targets in huge and intricate sandbox levels with complete freedom of approach. Where to go, when to strike and who to kill – it is all up to you.\n\nHITMAN is an expanding and evolving world of assassination. The experience began with a Prologue and Paris location in March, continued with Episode 2: Sapienza in April, Episode 3: Marrakesh in May, the Summer Bonus Episode in July, Episode 4: Bangkok in August and Episode 5: Colorado in September. The season finale in Hokkaido, Japan arrived on October 31st.\n\nHITMAN also features a major live component, which is made up of Elusive Targets, Escalation Contracts, Community-inspired Challenge Packs and Contracts Mode.\n\nAn Elusive Target is the closest thing to the Hitman fantasy that we’ve ever created. These targets will be custom-created characters that are added to existing locations and are only there for a limited time in real-time. You’ll only have one chance to take them down. If they escape, they are gone for good. If you kill them, that’s the way that you killed them. There are no do-overs and no second chances. When an Elusive Target leaves the game world (one way or another) they never return.\n\nEscalation Mode is something else completely new for HITMAN and was created as a way to regularly provide a fresh challenge to players. You’ll need to master the location as well as the gameplay mechanics to complete a hit that will escalate in difficulty by adding new elements. This mode has a strong focus on having fun with the game mechanics and mixing them up. It’s more about being playful than realistic.\n\nContracts Mode returns from Hitman Absolution; Play-to-create, mark your own targets, choose how to kill them and compete against your friends. We will also pick the best of the bunch and put them in the Featured Contracts list so you’ve got something fresh to play whenever you load up the game.","['Epic Games Store', 'Humble Bundle', 'Steam']",79,['IO Interactive'],"['Adventure', 'Shooter', 'Tactical']","['IO Interactive', 'Square Enix']",2016-03-11,"['Action', 'Open world', 'Stealth']",205,,https://images.gog.com/d5931339f3b283a902cd88b40dd8013636c56b7be7917248a1e90fb0f5985636_glx_bg_top_padding_7.webp?namespace=gamesdb,https://images.gog.com/68309613e39ad04287c93a1129cbb6f8bd0840aa153b84837dc88c7d6fd2f745_glx_square_icon_v2.webp?namespace=gamesdb,https://images.gog.com/db32bedeb90dc42bf56f5c9eae8564d7fcb94598823fded3fa9aa78e69905a56_glx_vertical_cover.webp?namespace=gamesdb

L.A. Noire,"L.A. Noire is a neo-noir detective action-adventure video game developed by Team Bondi and published by Rockstar Games. It was initially released for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 platforms on 17 May 2011; a Microsoft Windows port was later released on 8 November 2011.\n\nL.A. Noire is set in Los Angeles in 1947 and challenges the player, controlling a Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) officer, to solve a range of cases across five divisions. Players must investigate crime scenes for clues, follow up leads, and interrogate suspects, and the player's success at these activities will impact how much of each case's story is revealed.\n\nThe game draws heavily from both the plot and aesthetic elements of film noir—stylistic films made popular in the 1940s and 1950s that share similar visual styles and themes, including crime and moral ambiguity—along with drawing inspiration from real-life crimes for its in-game cases, based upon what was reported by the Los Angeles media in 1947.\n\nThe game uses a distinctive colour palette, but in homage to film noir it includes the option to play the game in black and white. Various plot elements reference the major themes of detective and mobster stories such as The Naked City, Chinatown, The Untouchables, The Black Dahlia, and L.A. Confidential.",['Steam'],89,"['Rockstar Leeds', 'Rockstar North', 'Team Bondi']",['Adventure'],"['Rockstar Games', 'Take-Two Interactive']",2011-11-08,"['Action', 'Historical', 'Open world', 'Sandbox', 'Thriller']",27,,https://images.gog.com/59dd31d05ef3475acba970c8ea5a568a0e5facaad704722eb895bbd3ef4c20d0_glx_bg_top_padding_7.webp?namespace=gamesdb,https://images.gog.com/e6c10fcffa15fbab75567ed8784e4a646b0e30c19039c7c33bd13b461e509db2_glx_square_icon_v2.webp?namespace=gamesdb,https://images.gog.com/49cbab5e3cef2e17282bdae605040737be59ff71a3a82c307cde690f78f14e58_glx_vertical_cover.webp?namespace=gamesdb

Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time™,"Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time is a third-person puzzle-platformer and action-adventure computer and video game published by Ubisoft. It was released on November 21, 2003 and is a reboot of the landmark video game series Prince of Persia, created by Jordan Mechner in 1989.\n\nThe Sands of Time, developed internally at Ubisoft Montreal, successfully captures the mechanics of the original platformer and extends it to the 3D generation. An earlier attempt by The Learning Company to transfer the game to 3D (Prince of Persia 3D) was released in 1999, but despite its initial good reception failed to sell enough and the company responsible for the original trilogy was already closing doors. The game was praised for its visual design, finely tuned game mechanics and intriguing storyline, winning the game several awards.\n\nThe game was developed for the PC, PlayStation 2, GameCube, Xbox, and later a 2D-version for the Game Boy Advance and mobile phones. The success of The Sands of Time led to three followups, Prince of Persia: Warrior Within (2004), Prince of Persia: The Two Thrones (2005), and Prince of Persia: The Forgotten Sands (2010). A remastered, high-definition, version of The Sands of Time was released on the PlayStation Network for the PlayStation 3 on November 16, 2010.",['Uplay'],84,['Ubisoft Montreal'],"['Adventure', 'Platform']","['Sony Computer Entertainment, Inc.

Rabbids Coding,"Rabbids Coding is a game created to be a fun and engaging educational experience, giving people the tools to get excited about learning to code, without constant supervision or instruction from a teacher. It gives you the independence to learn at your own pace, whatever your age. Your goal in each level is to provide the simplest instructions possible to get the task done. Once you've proven yourself in the basics, a sandbox environment becomes available, allowing you to explore and play with the instructions to see what you can do.\n\nProgramming can seem like a very mysterious topic to the uninitiated. Well, fear not! Here are some top terms to help you get started on your journey:\nCode – Written instructions you can use to give instructions to a computer.\nProgramming language – Your PC can't talk (well, not really, anyway) and you need a way to tell it what to do. A programming language is just that: a language your computer understands so that you can speak with it.\nLoop – No need to repeat yourself; with a loop, you can write some instructions then repeat them as many times as you need to in order to get the job done.\nAlgorithm – A set of instructions that solve a problem or perform a task. Think of these like useful little phrases.\nCondition – These are quite specific instructions. They tell a computer to only perform a certain action when a condition is met. For example: ""Computer, if I click on the web browser app, open my web browser.""\nOptimization – Computers only have so much memory, and so the goal of many programmers is to provide the simplest instructions possible to get the job done. The simpler the instructions, the less memory they take to run, and the more efficient your program will be.\nRabbid – Rabbit-like creatures that ruin spaceships, but fortunately can be tamed with mind-control devices and dropped sausages.",['Uplay'],,['Ubisoft USA'],,['Ubisoft USA'],2019-10-08,,,,https://images.gog.com/137f9773e4f81fc0170fbf8114019f0fd67c86b567f4495e9b8c58e642e74b35_glx_bg_top_padding_7.webp?namespace=gamesdb,https://images.gog.com/2125838bff82cb7fb034a9df32d467f3cfc485d3b21ec86b8a0654d173193cc5_glx_square_icon_v2.webp?namespace=gamesdb,https://images.gog.com/2125838bff82cb7fb034a9df32d467f3cfc485d3b21ec86b8a0654d173193cc5_glx_vertical_cover.webp?namespace=gamesdb

Rising Storm,"Rising Storm is the next game in the award-winning Red Orchestra franchise. You know the great gameplay, innovative features and realistic audio and graphics of RO2 - Rising Storm will take this to the Pacific Theater, adding even more features, new levels, new weapons and new factions. The game will allow the player to fight across iconic locations from the famous island-hopping campaigns in the Pacific from 1942 to 1945, as the US Army and Marine Corps fight it out with the Imperial Japanese army and Special Naval Landing Forces. Players will experience beach assaults, jungle fighting, close quarters night fighting and more across Guadalcanal, Iwo Jima and Saipan, among other iconic battles. The player is able to take the part of either side – American or Japanese – battling it out online in multiplayer on up to 64-player servers.\n\nRising Storm also introduces an entirely new type of gameplay to the franchise - asymmetrical warfare. The American’s have the apparent advantage in firepower with their fast firing semi-automatic rifles, fully automatic weapons, and devastating flamethrower. The Japanese balance this out with gameplay elements that model their raw courage, ferocity, and cunning use of equipment. Their knee mortars allow them to rain indirect fire down on their enemies from anywhere in the map. Grenades can be planted and turned into booby-traps for unwary GIs. The Japanese put very high store on close-quarter combat, with a bayonet on almost every weapon – even machine guns and SMGs. Their banzai charge suppresses the enemy making it difficult for them to return fire and gives them an opportunity to close in to use bayonets and katanas on their opponents.",['Humble Bundle'],,"['Antimatter Games', 'Tripwire Interactive']","['Shooter', 'Simulator']","['Lace Mamba Global', 'Tripwire Interactive']",2013-05-30,"['Action', 'Historical', 'Warfare']",,,https://images.gog.com/1d2f169151dac9c738ca934c6f6169eb050472e58d018e710e5dc82185a31e0f_glx_bg_top_padding_7.webp?namespace=gamesdb,https://images.gog.com/e55bb545b4c4845ed99f9f3a4379a1f70bb8f048969fcfd62ef9410c79750f72_glx_square_icon_v2.webp?namespace=gamesdb,https://images.gog.com/e55bb545b4c4845ed99f9f3a4379a1f70bb8f048969fcfd62ef9410c79750f72_glx_vertical_cover.webp?namespace=gamesdb

Sins of a Solar Empire: Rebellion,"The Next Installment to the Award-Winning RTS.\n\nWhile many were hopeful that diplomacy would finally end the war, differing opinions on what should be done, along with the depleted power of the controlling factions, has led to a splintering of the groups involved.\n\nThe loyalist members of the Trader Emergency Coalition adopt a policy of isolation, focusing on enhanced defenses to ride out the rest of the war. Those who rebel against the coalition take on a purely militant view, coming to the opinion that the only way to bring peace is by ultimately crushing all who oppose them - especially xenos.\n\nFor the first time in their history, the war creates a schism in the Advent Unity. The loyalists seek to continue their policy of revenge against the Traders, and to assimilate all others to the Unity’s influence. However, others amongst the Advent suspect that a corrupting influence from within has diverted the Unity from its proper destiny.\n\nThe divide created in the Vasari Empire is less pronounced, but just as severe to their people. With the Vasari now practically frantic to move on to new space, the loyalist faction abandons cooperation and decides to take the resources they need by any means necessary. Having accepted the need to work together, the rebel faction feels that their best chance for survival is to work with the other races and bring them along to flee the approaching enemy.\n\nTake the battle for galactic supremacy to its ultimate level in Sins of a Solar Empire: Rebellion – a standalone RT4X game that combines the tactics of real-time strategy with the depth of the 4X genre (eXplore, eXpand, eXploit, eXterminate).","['Humble Bundle', 'Steam']",85,"['Ironclad Games', 'Stardock']","['Indie', 'Real Time Strategy (RTS)', 'Strategy']",['Stardock'],2012-06-12,"['4X (explore, expand, exploit, and exterminate)', 'Science fiction']",,,https://images.gog.com/95bb885ac95d014db3a48abca8cba4062d9328bfad62b0e2e7b8ecc47b903be3_glx_bg_top_padding_7.webp?namespace=gamesdb,https://images.gog.com/f9fc055b020353dcd0b9829db83703529c973e8beb880ce16fd07611283f87f6_glx_square_icon_v2.webp?namespace=gamesdb,https://images.gog.com/f9fc055b020353dcd0b9829db83703529c973e8beb880ce16fd07611283f87f6_glx_vertical_cover.webp?namespace=gamesdb

Sniper Elite,"Sniper Elite is a third-person action strategy game with a focus on sniping. The player takes on the role of an American agent working for the OSS (the organization that later became the CIA) stationed in Berlin at the end of World War II, tasked with preventing the Russian troops from getting hold of the research Germany had been conducting into nuclear weaponry. As an elite sniper, the style of play is much less run-and-gun and much more about finding good positions, lining up shots and taking out the enemy before he even knows where you are.\n\nThe single-player campaign takes place over 28 missions set in and around Berlin. Players use stealth tactics, and things like wind and background noise can be a factor when lining up shots. When a shot is performed particularly well, players are rewarded with a 'bullet cam' which follows the bullet in slow-motion from gun barrel to target.","['Humble Bundle', 'Steam']",80,['Rebellion Developments'],"['Shooter', 'Simulator', 'Strategy', 'Tactical']",['MC2 France'],2005-09-30,"['Action', 'Fantasy', 'Historical', 'Stealth', 'Warfare']",,,https://images.gog.com/158032c14f1acc6819869441c53ed7d22aa14d65a6bb1635e1073db27f483d33_glx_bg_top_padding_7.webp?namespace=gamesdb,https://images.gog.com/f607b99c9b6d55bcfdf884d43a7128da1a9b798c9a097b900d6149ccade6e93a_glx_square_icon_v2.webp?namespace=gamesdb,https://images.gog.com/f607b99c9b6d55bcfdf884d43a7128da1a9b798c9a097b900d6149ccade6e93a_glx_vertical_cover.webp?namespace=gamesdb

The player collects resources and other hidden resources which can be brought back to the surface and exchanged for cash. When the player progress in the game new abilities are unlocked. Each playthrough, the mines are randomized, making items and treasure appear in different locations. If the player gets stuck there is a self destruct function, but the players can also buy ladders in the store at the surface to get out of tricky situations.\nWhen progressing deeper down in the cave, the player encounters various enemies with different attack patterns and weak spots. The game features multiple worlds, each with a completely different environment. Dying results in a reparation penalty fee, and the player respawns back on the surface.

Stygian: Reign of the Old Ones,"""Stygian: Reign of the Old Ones"" is a supernatural horror roleplaying video game which takes place in the strange worlds of Howard Phillips Lovecraft. Stygian will draw the player into a bleak journey from a ruined Arkham to the very depths of the Abyss.\n\nThe gameplay experience promises a mix of rich role-playing and turn based tactical combat in an authentic illustrative 2D graphical style.\n\nIn Stygian, you'll be able to create your character from scratch with a robust selection of archetypal backgrounds with different origin stories, attributes, skills, traits and lastly belief systems which determine how your character replenishes lost sanity, also presenting unique dialog choices.\n\nThe narrative of the game is strongly connected to the works of H. P. Lovecraft. In your quest, you'll use the haunted violin of Erich Zann to lure a fiendish deity and convince the poor wretched protagonist of ""The Outsider"" to join your party among many others.\n\nThe heavy burden of fighting a desperate battle with forces beyond recognition will haunt you to the end of the game. Physical combat will be scarce and difficult, spellcasting will have deep and dangerous consequences, sanity loss will leave its marks on characters as mental illnesses and sometimes the best solution will be running away from the terrors that lurk in the night.\n\nStygian embraces the original themes of pulp and weird fiction, incorporating them into the computer roleplaying genre, promising a fresh (or putrid from another perspective) breath of air for roleplaying fans.",['Humble Bundle'],,['Cultic Games'],['Role-playing (RPG)'],['1C Company'],2019-09-26,"['Fantasy', 'Horror']",,,https://images.gog.com/653de01bc3ab027fcfaf164e1f8e34d6395272574b698890c0ab56f2488ce7dd_glx_bg_top_padding_7.webp?namespace=gamesdb,https://images.gog.com/dce3880ea4e046571fed0e6a18f764ee3ca8b155ca6a4dd609c96e9c54689df8_glx_square_icon_v2.webp?namespace=gamesdb,https://images.gog.com/5d0b609c20531f8177c453563807e7ea39295e75fa32de871600fe4406e62501_glx_vertical_cover.webp?namespace=gamesdb

Supraland,"Supraland is a First-Person Metroidvania Puzzle game. The main sources of inspiration are Zelda, Metroid and Portal. Supraland assumes that you are intelligent and lets you play independently. The story is minimal, gives you an overarching goal to pursue, and then sets you free.\n\n– Metroidvania –\nYou explore a large interconnected world in which most ways are at first unpassable until you find new abilities to overcome those obstacles. A cornerstone of Supraland’s design was to create abilities that are so versatile, they will keep on surprising you by how many different usages they have. If you combine your abilities, the possibilities become even bigger.\n\n– Exploration –\nMost of the game is about exploring the sandbox world to track down secrets. Often you will think you are about to get out of bounds and beat the level designer, but right there is a chest waiting for you with a very rewarding upgrade. Supraland respects your lifetime and doesn’t bloat the playtime with unlimited no-brainer collectibles.\n\n– Puzzle Design –\nThe deeper you get into the game the more you will be facing creative puzzles you’ve never seen anywhere before, encouraging you to stop and think about what abilities you have and how you can use them in yet another way. Puzzle types that I already knew from other games were immediately rejected in the design process. And it’s important to me that once you understand the idea behind a puzzle, you can pretty much immediately solve it instead of having to go through a cumbersome, frustrating execution.\n\n– Fighting –\nThe fighting mechanics are inspired by old-school, fast-paced shooter games like Unreal, Doom and Quake, encouraging high-speed strafing and jumping while throwing shot after shot at hordes of charging enemies without ever having to worry about weapons reloading.",['Humble Bundle'],80,['Supra Games UG'],"['Adventure', 'Indie', 'Platform', 'Puzzle']",['Supra Games UG'],2019-04-05,"['Action', 'Sandbox']",,,https://images.gog.com/1af8963b0b5b7d97dfaab6c9726d8d4d6ed8622e15996fd8dfd7ddfd6b2ac591_glx_bg_top_padding_7.webp?namespace=gamesdb,https://images.gog.com/b2ef435d93b24feb8cfd7e5bf41cf74e0b426a3a9751be1413b90921705df913_glx_square_icon_v2.webp?namespace=gamesdb,https://images.gog.com/7cc2a0f66a2cae4a6393e4ba0ac551ebd379e3a9fc9f075b6360d94fd822f3df_glx_vertical_cover.webp?namespace=gamesdb

Once you enter the underworld you have to deal with all the consequences - you are not the only one out there looking for decent loot. Hide in the shadows of the dark, savage city.

You can use sound to your advantage - it’s not only your main source of information on how close your enemies are but you can use it to distract them, for example by throwing objects. With unscripted levels, and objectives and paths altered based on difficulty settings, Thief Gold can give you hours of non-repetitive gameplay.\n\nThis extended edition includes all of the missions from the first release, as well as three new missions adapted to the original storyline, with full voice acting and new graphics.

Wasteland,"The game mechanics were based directly on those used in the tabletop role-playing games Tunnels and Trolls and Mercenaries, Spies and Private Eyes created by Wasteland developers Ken St. Andre and Michael Stackpole. Characters in Wasteland consequently have various statistics (strength, intelligence and luck among others) that allow them to use different skills and weapons. Experience is gained through battle and through use of skills. The game would generally let players advance with a variety of tactics: to get through a locked gate, a player could use his picklock skill, his climb skill, or his strength attribute; or he could force the gate with a crowbar - or a LAW rocket.\n\nThe initial band of Desert Rangers encountered a number of NPCs as the game progressed who could be recruited into the party of up to seven. Unlike those of other computer RPGs of the time, these NPCs might temporarily refuse to give up an item or perform an action if ordered to do so. The game was also noted for its high and unforgiving difficulty level and for such combat prose as ""reduced to a thin red paste"" and ""explodes like a blood sausage"", which prompted an unofficial PG-13 sticker on the game packaging in the United States.\n\nWasteland was one of the first games featuring a persistent world, where changes to the game world were stored and kept. Returning to areas later in the game, one would find them in the state one left them in, instead of being reset to their original state, as was common for games of the time. Since hard drives were still rare in home computers in 1988, this meant the original game disk had to be copied first, as the manual instructed one to do.",['Humble Bundle'],100,['Interplay Productions'],"['Adventure', 'Indie', 'Role-playing (RPG)', 'Strategy']",['Electronic Arts'],1988-12-31,"['Science fiction', 'Survival']",,,https://images.gog.com/4e76b76071a55ef9043247f0c3522b7b2604c6adb41dfb0022b85c56a06f37aa_glx_bg_top_padding_7.webp?namespace=gamesdb,https://images.gog.com/d74df162ba4ff11e225ec690d36ce96641d4d75bb2232327bc702f6df71fd18c_glx_square_icon_v2.webp?namespace=gamesdb,https://images.gog.com/d74df162ba4ff11e225ec690d36ce96641d4d75bb2232327bc702f6df71fd18c_glx_vertical_cover.webp?namespace=gamesdb
